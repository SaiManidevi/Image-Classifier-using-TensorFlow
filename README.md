## Project Introduction
Using the Oxford 102 Category Flower Dataset, built an Image Classifier that predicts and recognizes different species of flowers. The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Loading the image dataset and creating a pipeline.
* Building and Training an image classifier on this dataset.
* Using the trained model to perform inference on flower images.

## Programming Language and Libraries used: 
This project uses **Python 3** and is designed to be completed through the **Jupyter Notebooks IDE.**

The following libraries were used in this project:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Tensorflow
* Tensorflow Hub

## Contents:
* Project_Image_Classifier_Project_colab_2.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the steps showcasing how the model is created/trained/tested.
* report.html: HTML version of the jupyter notebook
* my_saved_model.h5: Classifier model
* /part_2/predict.py: Python application that uses our classifier model to predict flower type
